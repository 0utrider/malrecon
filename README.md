MalRecon - Basic Malware Reconnaissance Tool
by Outrider

https://github.com/0utrider

Usage:	Performs basic malware/download reconnaissance of URLs (curl, wget, hashing, etc.)

Syntax:	$ malrecon [URL] [Case No.]

Example:	$ malrecon http://malwaredomain.org/payload1 IN123456

This is just a simple tool used to automate some of the more mundane tasks when obtaining malware for analysis. The final action is to compress/encrypt all of the files in a 7z for portability and analysis.

I plan to add more features as I think of them - if you have any ideas, especially for more useful tools and outputs, please let me know!
